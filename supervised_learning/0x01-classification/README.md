# **Classification**

In machine learning, classification refers to a predictive modeling problem where a class label is predicted for a given example of input data.

This project is devides in three parts to perform a Binary classification (tasks that have two class labels.
)

**Part 1:** Write a class `Neuron` that defines a *single neuron* performing binary classification.

**Part 2:** Write a class `NeuralNetwork` that defines a *neural network with one hidden* layer performing binary classification.

**Part 3:** Write a class `DeepNeuralNetwork` that defines a *deep neural network* performing binary classification.

* What is a one-hot vector?
* How to encode/decode one-hot vectors
* What is the softmax function and when do you use it?

### **Requirements**
* Unless otherwise noted, you are not allowed to import any module except `import numpy as np`
* Unless otherwise noted, you are not allowed to use any loops (`for`, `while`, etc.)

### **Testing your code**

In order to test your code, youâ€™ll need DATA! Please download these datasets (`Binary_Train.npz`, `Binary_Dev.npz`, `MNIST.npz`) to go along with all of the following main files. All of the following code assumes that you have stored all of your datasets in a separate `data` directory.
