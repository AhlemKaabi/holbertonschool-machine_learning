# **Time Series Forecasting**


**Bitcoin (BTC) became a trending topic after its price peaked in 2018. Many have sought to predict its value in order to accrue wealth. Letâ€™s attempt to use our knowledge of RNNs to attempt just that.**

**Given the coinbase and bitstamp datasets, write a script, `forecast_btc.py`, that *creates*, *trains*, and *validates a keras model* for the forecasting of BTC:**

* Your model should use the past 24 hours of BTC data to predict the value of BTC at the close of the following hour (approximately how long the average transaction takes):
* The datasets are formatted such that every row represents a 60 second time window containing:
	* The start time of the time window in Unix time
	* The open price in USD at the start of the time window
	* The high price in USD within the time window
	* The low price in USD within the time window
	* The close price in USD at end of the time window
	* The amount of BTC transacted in the time window
	* The amount of Currency (USD) transacted in the time window
	* The volume-weighted average price in USD for the time window
* Your model should use an `RNN architecture` of your choosing
* Your model should use `mean-squared error (MSE)` as its cost function
* You should use a `tf.data.Dataset` to feed data to your model

Because the dataset is raw, you will need to create a script, `preprocess_data.py` to preprocess this data. Here are some things to consider:

* Are all of the data points useful?
* Are all of the data features useful?
* Should you rescale the data?
* Is the current time window relevant?
* How should you save this preprocessed data?

## **Learning Objectives**

* What is time series forecasting?

	* Time series forecasting occurs when you make scientific predictions based on historical time stamped data. It involves building models through historical analysis and using them to make observations and drive future strategic decision-making.

	* Time series data can be phrased as supervised learning.

* What is a stationary process?
* What is a sliding window?

	* The use of prior time steps to predict the next time step is called the sliding window method. For short, it may be called the window method in some literature. In statistics and time series analysis, this is called a lag or lag method. The number of previous time steps is called the window width or size of the lag.
