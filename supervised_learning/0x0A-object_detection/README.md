# **Object Detection**

**[Object detection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_detection)** is a computer technology related to computer vision and image processing that deals with detecting instances of semantic objects of a certain class (such as humans, buildings, or cars) in digital images and videos. Well-researched domains of object detection include **face detection** and **pedestrian detection**. Object detection has applications in many areas of computer vision, including image retrieval and video surveillance.


### **Concept**

**Every object class has its own special features** that helps in classifying the class – for example all circles are round. Object class detection uses these *special features*. For example, when looking for circles, objects that are at a particular distance from a point (i.e. the center) are sought. Similarly, when looking for squares, objects that are perpendicular at corners and have equal side lengths are needed. A similar approach is used for face identification where eyes, nose, and lips can be found and features like skin color and distance between eyes can be found.

### **Methods**

* neural network-based approaches
	* Region Proposals (R-CNN, Fast R-CNN, nFaster R-CNN, cascade R-CNN.)
	* Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD)
	* You Only Look Once (YOLO)
	* Single-Shot Refinement Neural Network for Object Detection (RefineDet)
	* Retina-Net
	* Deformable convolutional networks
* Non-neural approaches
	* Viola–Jones object detection framework based on Haar features
	* Scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT)
	* Histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) features
