# **Natural Language Processing - Evaluation Metrics**

## **Learning Objectives**

* What are the applications of natural language processing?
* What is a BLEU score?
* What is a ROUGE score?
* What is perplexity?
* When should you use one evaluation metric over another?

[The history of NLP](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/courses/soco/projects/2004-05/nlp/overview_history.html):


from 1957-1970, researchers split into two divisions concerning NLP: symbolic and stochastic.
* Symbolic, or rule-based, researchers focused on formal languages and generating syntax; this group consisted of many linguists and computer scientists who considered this branch the beginning of artificial intelligence research.
* Stochastic researchers were more interested in statistical and probabilistic methods of NLP, working on problems of `optical character recognition` and `pattern recognition` between texts.

After 1970, researchers split even further,

One new area was logic-based paradigms, languages that focused on encoding rules and language in mathematical logics.

 Natural language understanding was another area of NLP that was particularly influenced by SHRDLU, Professor Terry Winogradâ€™s doctoral thesis.
