# Convolutions and Pooling

In **mathematics** (in particular, *functional analysis*), `convolution` is a mathematical operation on two functions (f and g) that produces a third function ( f ∗ g ) that expresses how the shape of one is modified by the other.

The term **convolution** refers to both the result function and to the process of computing it. It is defined as the **integral** of the product of the two functions after one is reversed and shifted. The integral is evaluated for all values of shift, producing the convolution function - [reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolution).
